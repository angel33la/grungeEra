        Many music subcultures are associated with particular drugs, such as the hippie counterculture and reggae, both of which
        are associated with marijuana and psychedelics. In the 1990s, the media focused on the use of heroin by musicians in the
        Seattle grunge scene, with a 1992 New York Times article listing the city's "three principal drugs" as "espresso, beer
        and heroin" and a 1996 article calling Seattle's grunge scene the "... subculture that has most strongly embraced
        heroin". <em>Tim Jonze</em> from The Guardian states that "... heroin had blighted the [grunge] scene ever since its
        inception in the mid-80s" and he argues that the "... involvement of heroin mirrors the self-hating, nihilistic aspect
        to the music"; in addition to the heroin deaths, Jonze points out that <strong>Stone Temple Pilots'</strong> <em>Scott Weiland</em>, as well as
        <em>Courtney Love</em>, <em>Mark Lanegan</em>, <em>Jimmy Chamberlin</em> and <em>Evan Dando</em> "... all had their run-ins with the drug, but lived to tell
        the tale." A 2014 book stated that whereas in the 1980s, people used the "stimulant" cocaine to socialize and "...
        celebrate good times", in the 1990s grunge scene, the "depressant" heroin was used to "retreat" into a "cocoon" and be
        "... sheltered from a harsh and unforgiving world which offered ... few prospects for ... change or hope." <em>Justin
        Henderson</em> states that all of the "downer" opiates, including "heroin, morphine, etorphine, codeine, opium, [and]
        hydrocodone ... seemed to be the habit of choice for many a grunger"

        The title of <strong>Nirvana's</strong> debut album Bleach was inspired by a harm reduction poster aimed at heroin injection users, which
        stated "Bleach your works [e.g., syringe and needle] before you get stoned". The poster was released by the U.S. State
        Health Department which was trying to reduce AIDS transmission caused through sharing used needles. <strong>Alice in Chains'</strong>
        song "God Smack" includes the line "stick your arm for some real fun", a reference to injecting heroin. Seattle
        musicians known to use heroin included <em>Cobain</em>, who was using "heroin when he shot himself in the head"; "<em>Andrew Wood</em> of
        Mother Love Bone [who] overdosed on heroin in 1990"; "<em>Stefanie Sargent</em> of 7 Year Bitch [who] died of an overdose of the
        same opiate in 1992 ... [and] <em>Layne Staley</em> of <strong>Alice in Chains</strong>, [who] publicly detailed his battles with heroin ...".
        <em>Mike Starr</em> of <strong>Alice in Chains</strong> and <em>Jonathan Melvoin</em> from the <strong>Smashing Pumpkins</strong> also died from heroin. After <em>Cobain's</em>
        death, his "... widow, singer <em>Courtney Love</em>, characterized Seattle as a drug mecca, where heroin is easier to get than
        in San Francisco or Los Angeles."

        However, <em>Daniel House</em>, who owned <strong>C/Z Records</strong>, disputed these perceptions in 1994. House stated that there was "... no
        more (heroin) here [in Seattle] than anyplace else"; he stated that the "heroin is not a big part of the [Seattle music]
        culture", and that "marijuana and alcohol ... are far more prevalent". <em>Jeff Gilbert</em>, one of the editors of Guitar World
        magazine, stated in 1994 that the media association of the Seattle grunge scene with heroin was "really overblown";
        instead, he says that Seattle musicians were "... all a bunch of potheads." <em>Gil Troy's</em> history of America in the
        1990s states that in the Seattle grunge scene, the "... drug of choice switched from upscale cocaine [of the 1980s] to
        blue-collar marijuana." Rolling Stone magazine reported that members of Seattle's grunge scene were "coffee-crazed"
        by day on espresso and "... by night, they quaff[ed] oceans of beer jolted by Java and looped with liquor, no wonder
        the [grunge] music sounds like it does." "Some [Seattle] scene veterans maintain that MDA", a drug related to
        Ecstasy, "was a vital contributor to grunge", because it gave users a "body high" (in contrast to marijuana's "head
        high") that made them appreciate "bass-heavy grooves". Pat Long's History of the NME states that scene members
        involved with the <strong>Sub Pop</strong> label would have multi-day MDMA parties in the woods, which shows that what Long calls
        Ecstasy's "warm glow" had an impact even in the wet, grey and isolated Pacific Northwest region.
