    <p><strong>Grunge</strong> (sometimes referred to as the Seattle sound) is an <em>alternative rock genre and
        subculture</em> that emerged during the mid-1980s in the American Pacific Northwest state of Washington,
      particularly in Seattle and nearby towns. <strong>Grunge</strong> fuses
      elements of punk rock and heavy metal, but without punk's structure and speed. The genre featured the distorted
      electric guitar sound used in both genres, although some bands performed with more emphasis on one or the other.
      Like
      these genres, grunge typically uses electric guitar, bass guitar, drums and vocals. Grunge also incorporates
      influences
      from indie rock bands such as <em>Sonic Youth.</em> Lyrics are typically angst-filled and introspective, often
      addressing themes
      such as social alienation, self-doubt, abuse, neglect, betrayal, social and emotional isolation, addiction,
      psychological trauma and a desire for freedom.</p>
    <p>The early grunge movement revolved around Seattle's independent record label <em>Sub Pop</em> and the region's
      <em>underground music</em>
      scene. The owners of Sub Pop marketed the style shrewdly, encouraging the media to describe it as "grunge"; the
      style
      became known as a hybrid of <em>punk and metal</em>. By the early 1990s, its popularity had spread, with grunge
      bands
      appearing in California, then emerging in other parts of the United States and in Australia, building strong
      followings
      and signing major record deals. Grunge was commercially successful in the early-to-mid-1990s due to releases such
      as
      <strong>Nirvana's</strong> <em>Nevermind</em>, <strong>Pearl Jam's</strong> <em>Ten</em>,
      <strong>Soundgarden's</strong> <em>Superunknown</em>, <strong>Alice in Chains'</strong> <em>Dirt</em>, and
      <strong>Stone Temple Pilots'</strong> <em>Core</em>. The success of these bands boosted the popularity of
      alternative rock and made grunge the most popular form of rock music at the time.
    </p>
    <p>Several factors contributed to grunge's decline in prominence. During the mid-to-late 1990s, many grunge bands
      broke up
      or became less visible. Nirvana's <strong>Kurt Cobain</strong>, labeled by <em>Time</em> as "the John Lennon of
      the swinging Northwest", struggled
      with an addiction to heroin before his suicide in 1994. Although most grunge bands had disbanded or faded from
      view by
      the late 1990s, they influenced modern rock music, as their lyrics brought socially conscious issues into pop
      culture
      and added introspection and an exploration of what it means to be true to oneself. Grunge was also an influence on
      later genres such as post-grunge.</p>
